# Reinforcement-Learning-Basics
Overview of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm in machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, receives feedback in the form of rewards (or penalties), and uses this feedback to adjust its behavior so that it can maximize its cumulative reward over time. Below is a comprehensive overview of reinforcement learning, followed by a Python example of a simple RL algorithm, and finally an application to a new real-world problem with a dataset.

1. Overview of Reinforcement Learning

Key Concepts
Agent and Environment:
The agent is the learner or decision maker, and the environment is everything the agent interacts with. At each time step, the agent observes the current state of the environment and decides which action to take.
State, Action, and Reward:
State (s): A representation of the current situation of the environment.
Action (a): The decision or move that the agent takes.
Reward (r): A scalar feedback signal received after an action. It indicates the immediate benefit (or cost) of taking that action.
Policy (π):
A policy is a strategy or mapping from states to actions. The agent’s behavior is defined by its policy, which it improves with experience.
Value Function:
This function estimates the expected cumulative future rewards that can be achieved from a given state (or state-action pair). Two common value functions are:
State Value Function (V(s))
Action Value Function (Q(s, a))
Exploration vs. Exploitation:
The agent must balance exploration (trying new actions to discover more information) and exploitation (choosing actions that yield high rewards based on current knowledge).
Popular RL Algorithms
Q-Learning:
A model-free algorithm that estimates the Q-value for every state-action pair and updates the value based on the Bellman equation. It can be used even when the model (dynamics of the environment) is unknown.
Policy Gradient Methods:
These methods directly optimize the policy by adjusting its parameters in order to maximize the expected reward.
Deep Reinforcement Learning:
Combines RL with deep neural networks (e.g., Deep Q-Networks, or DQN) to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
